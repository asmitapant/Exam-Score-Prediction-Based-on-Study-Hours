# Exam-Score-Prediction-Based-on-Study-Hours
This R script visualizes the relationship between hours spent studying and exam performance using a scatterplot and simple linear regression. A custom dataset is plotted, and a regression line is added to reveal the positive trend between study hours and scores. The red line helps identify how well the number of hours studied predicts exam outcomes, ideal for educational analytics or beginner regression practice in R.
In this Code a dataframe study_data is created with study hours and exam scores. A scatterplot visualizes each observation.A linear model is fitted as lm(ExamScore ~ StudyHours)
 and abline() adds the regression line, showing the predicted score trend.
